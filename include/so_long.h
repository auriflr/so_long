/* The playerâ€™s goal is to collect all collectibles on the map 
and then escape by choosing the shortest possible route. 
Maps are built from characters:
1 for walls
0 for (walking) spaces
C for Collectibles
P for Player
E for exit 
Controls use the keyboard:
W for moving up
S for moving down
D for moving to the right
A for moving to the left
ESC to exit */
